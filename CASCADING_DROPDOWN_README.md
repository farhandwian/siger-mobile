# Cascading Dropdown Implementation - createTask.tsx

## Overview
Successfully implemented cascading dropdown functionality with API integration for the task creation form.

## Key Features

### üîÑ Cascading Dropdown Behavior
- **Proyek (Project)**: Always visible, populated from API data
- **Kegiatan (Activity)**: Only shows after selecting a project
- **Sub Kegiatan (Sub Activity)**: Only shows after selecting an activity
- Auto-resets dependent dropdowns when parent selection changes

### üåê API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3000/api/full-projects`
- **Fallback**: Mock data when API fails (for development)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback with user notification
- **Retry Option**: Users can retry API connection

### üì± User Experience
- Loading indicator while fetching data
- Search functionality in all dropdowns
- Disabled state styling for inactive dropdowns
- Form validation with clear error messages
- Offline mode with demo data

## Data Structure
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "project_id",
      "pekerjaan": "Project Name",
      "activities": [
        {
          "id": "activity_id",
          "name": "Activity Name",
          "subActivities": [
            {
              "id": "sub_activity_id",
              "name": "Sub Activity Name"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage Flow
1. App loads ‚Üí Fetches project data from API
2. User selects project ‚Üí Activity dropdown becomes available
3. User selects activity ‚Üí Sub-activity dropdown becomes available
4. Form validation ensures all required fields are selected
5. Successful submission proceeds to success screen

## Error Handling
- Network failures fall back to mock data
- User is notified about offline mode
- Retry option available for API connection
- Form validation prevents incomplete submissions

## Development Notes
- TypeScript compatible with proper type annotations
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Searchable dropdowns for better UX
- Modal-based dropdown implementation
- Proper state management with React hooks

## Testing
Run with `npm start` and test the cascading behavior:
1. Select a project to see activities appear
2. Select an activity to see sub-activities appear
3. Test offline mode when API server is not running
4. Verify form validation works correctly
