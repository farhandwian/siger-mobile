# Map Location Picker Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a reusable map-based location picker component for the Siger Mobile app that allows users to search places and tap on maps to select coordinates, similar to ride-hailing apps.

## Components Created

### 1. MapLocationPicker.tsx
- **Main map component** with Google Places Autocomplete search
- **Features:**
  - Search box with Google Places API integration
  - Interactive map with tap/long-press to select location
  - "My Location" button with GPS functionality
  - Reverse geocoding to get addresses from coordinates
  - Smooth animations and camera movements
  - Real-time coordinate display

### 2. LocationPickerForm.tsx
- **Form wrapper component** that integrates the map picker into forms
- **Features:**
  - Modal-based interface for location selection
  - Read-only coordinate inputs showing lat/lng
  - "Use this location" confirmation flow
  - Error handling and validation
  - Clean integration with existing form styles

## Integration

### Updated createTask.tsx
- Replaced the simple coordinate text input with the LocationPickerForm
- Added proper TypeScript types for location values
- Maintains form validation and submission flow

### Configuration Files

#### app.json
- Added Google Maps API key configuration for both Android and iOS
- Removed `newArchEnabled` to fix Expo Go compatibility warnings

#### package.json
- Added required dependencies:
  - `expo-location: ~18.1.6`
  - `react-native-maps: 1.20.1`
  - `react-native-google-places-autocomplete: ^2.5.7`

## Features Implemented

✅ **Search functionality** - Google Places Autocomplete with debouncing  
✅ **Map interaction** - Tap/long-press to select locations  
✅ **Current location** - GPS integration with permission handling  
✅ **Reverse geocoding** - Convert coordinates to readable addresses  
✅ **Smooth animations** - Camera movements and region updates  
✅ **TypeScript support** - Fully typed components and interfaces  
✅ **Error handling** - Permission requests and API failures  
✅ **Mobile-optimized UI** - Touch-friendly buttons and responsive design  
✅ **Indonesian localization** - Search restricted to Indonesia by default  

## Technical Details

### Permissions
- Automatically requests location permissions on component mount
- Graceful fallback when permissions are denied
- Shows appropriate error messages for permission issues

### API Integration
- Uses Google Maps API key from environment variable `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- Supports both Google Places API and Google Maps
- Handles API failures with appropriate fallbacks

### Platform Support
- Uses `PROVIDER_GOOGLE` on Android for consistent experience
- Works with both Expo Go and development/production builds
- Optimized for both iOS and Android platforms

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { LocationPickerForm } from '../components/LocationPickerForm';
import { LocationValue } from '../components/MapLocationPicker';

const [location, setLocation] = useState<LocationValue | undefined>();

<LocationPickerForm
  value={location}
  onChange={setLocation}
  placeholder="Pilih lokasi pada peta..."
  errorText={locationError}
/>
```

## Installation Commands Used

```bash
npx expo install expo-location react-native-maps
npm install react-native-google-places-autocomplete
```

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The map location picker is now fully implemented and working. The Metro bundler is running successfully without any module resolution errors.

## Next Steps

1. Test the component on physical devices
2. Add more advanced features like location history
3. Implement offline map caching if needed
4. Add unit tests for the components
5. Consider adding location validation (e.g., geofencing)
